=====================

Code for Buffalo is a platform for civic innovation. As an open source organization, you can fork our code including our website. Help us make the site better by [forking it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), adding new content or features, and [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)!

Note: This site is hosted with GitHub pages and, as such, any changes you make to the repository will immediately be reflected on codeforbuffalo.github.io.

## Updating content
Most minor content updates can be made simply by making changes on your forked copy of this repository, then submitting a pull request. For example, following every event, the file `_layouts/home/cta.html` should **always** be updated to reflect the date of the next event.

## Updating Call-to-Action for upcoming events
The CTA block just below the hero image can be quickly updated fairly easily:

1. Fork this repository to your own account if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the file `_includes/home/cta.html`
3. Edit the file on your forked copy of the repository to reflect the updated text that needs to appear in the Call-to-Action.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Come back to this repository, select `Pull Requests` and issue a `Pull Request` to merge your changes into the main repository.
6. The changes then should automatically appear on the site in a few minutes!

*Note: If you have admin privileges to this GH org, you may committ your updates directly to the repository without forking your own copy, but do so with vigilance.*
